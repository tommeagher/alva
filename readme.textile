h1. *Alva*

Alva is a nanoblog application built using the Flask Python microframework. 

It is a customized application based on the basic flaskr tutorial (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/introduction/), styled using Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

What have I added so far?
- Detailed pages for each post
- The ability to edit any post
- The ability to delete any post
- A public/private option with a view enabled by session login

The development of this application is ongoing, but you can see the alpha version deployed at http://ideas.tommeagher.com/

The current alpha version is 1.0.

A later version of Alva is also in development in Django.
